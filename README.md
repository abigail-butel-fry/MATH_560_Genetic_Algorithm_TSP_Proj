Overarching Question: "How does the obj. function value change with iteration number on TSPs of various sizes?"
- Want to record length of best tour seen so far at each iteration, graph that as y vs. x values of iteration number, and try to characterize how it changes 

Also, plan to vary: 
 - number of cities
 - population size
 - elitism

Additionally, this repo contains code that makes use of Google's OR-Tools TSP solver, and the solutions obtained from this code can be used when generating the initial populations in the GA code.
